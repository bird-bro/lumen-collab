## Execution Mode: SDD
## Started: 2026-10-29
## Base: e7d182e (branch: dev)

### Batch 1: Aggregator + lumen-bom (tasks 1.1-1.4)
- Status: Complete + Approved (commit 00cca62; review fixes commit follows)
- Commits: e7d182e..00cca62
- Review: Approved - deviations 1/2 accepted with reproduction evidence; Important-1 (dcm4che repo propagation) fixed in aggregator; Important-2 (reactor-only builds) documented
- Notes: implementer measured 1454 shared depMgmt keys, 0 version mismatch; okhttp 3.14.4-vs-3.14.9 drift avoided by adopting OPS's import order
- Notes: toolchain = lumen-sev/mvnw (wrapper 3.3.4 → Maven 3.9.9) + JDK 11 (/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk); settings.xml sanitized (aliyun mirror only, no credentials)

### Batch 2: OPS framework/common verbatim copy (tasks 2.1-2.3)
- Status: Complete + Approved (commit ab2baa7; review fixes commit follows)
- Commits: 6bd2cf6..ab2baa7
- Review: Approved - byte-faithfulness gate re-verified independently (36=36, 54=54, only recorded adaptations); Important-1 (D5 (a) scope) reconciled; Minor items deferred to B5 (settings URL modernization, dispose.properties mojake noted)
- Notes: deleted classes unreferenced in copied modules; OPS-wide consumers only in uncopied business modules

### Batch 3: lumen-auth shell (tasks 3.1-3.2)
- Status: Complete + Approved after fix (commits 6634be5 + fix eb34dd2)
- Commits: 94ca262..eb34dd2
- Review: Needs fixes -> fixed - Critical: Nacos config neutralization didn't reach bootstrap phase (12 live :8848 attempts); fixed via bootstrap.yml test-profile document, evidence 8848 grep 21->0, red reason unchanged (xss.excludes), surefire 2.95s->0.98s
- Notes: port 8081, scanBasePackages="org.birdbro"; D3 amendment recorded in coordination doc; Batch 4 red-test intelligence: token.* + xss.* properties will be the red

### Batch 4: Zero-infrastructure verification (tasks 4.1-4.3)
- Status: Complete (commit 2eecd07) - review in progress (mandatory gate 4)
- Commits: eb34dd2..2eecd07
- Review: Pending - 3 concerns to judge: test-only UserDetailsService stub / @MapperScan on AuthApplication (mirrors OPS launch, proven necessary by red rung 3) / druid-exclude fallback reverted for dummy-URL datasource (zero connect attempts proven)
- Notes: strict 4-rung green ladder, red captured verbatim (xss.excludes), 8848 grep = 0 on green, deferred modules absent

### Batch 5: Documentation and spec hygiene (tasks 5.1-5.5)
